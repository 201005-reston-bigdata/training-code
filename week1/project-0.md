### Project 0
A Scala CLI (Command Line Interface) application.  Data should be parsed from a CSV or JSON file and persisted to MongoDB.  The functionality of the application beyond that is up to you, but here are a few suggestions:
- journal app
- banking app
- business management system
- simple text-based game
- productivity tool

## Tech Stack
- Scala 2.13
  - File I/O
  - Collections
- MongoDB
- sbt
- git SCM (on GitHub)

## Presentation
- 5 minute live demo.  Present the application, not the code.

## Due Date
- Project 0 will be presented Wednesday, October 21 (Wednesday week 3)

Finishing your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as early as possible before iterating new features upon the project is highly recommended.  Plan ahead, and be sure to reach out to others when you need guidance (or offer your own to those in need)
