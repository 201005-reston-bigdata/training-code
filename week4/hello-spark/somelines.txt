here are some lines
for a demo

more lines here
yet more
lines in
the file
to make
more partitions
> more tasks
a good default
is to have
at least 2 or 3 times as many
partitions
as executors
each partition goes to a task
so 2-3 as many tasks as executors
helps spread computation
across the cluster
