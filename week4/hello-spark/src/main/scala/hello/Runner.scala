    // This does the same thing as our wordcount Mapreduce, and in general we
    // can do MapReduce jobs using spark like this.  It's simpler and cleaner
    // in many cases.
    // Since we're doing MapReduce here, we have our shuffle.  managing when
    // shuffles happen is key to writing efficient Spark applications.  The
    // shuffle in spark has the same downsides as it does in MapReduce, it uses
    // Map and Reduce operations under to achieve the shuffle.  It doesn't
    // sort by default.  Refresher on downsides: network traffic, disk I/O
    // we're doing 2 shuffles above, we should look to combine them.

    // when we were sorting by key we probably could combine them sorting by
    // value I'm less sure we can... hmm! maybe if we sort first.

    // Some operations that cause shuffles:
    // repartition and coalesce (these change the number of partitions)
    // groupByKey, reduceByKey, other byKey methods
    // joins will cause shuffles (connecting items in different datasets
    //  based on references, foreign keys)

    // Our RDDs need to be resilient, so we need to be able to recompute
    // them if there is a failure.
    // Every partition past our shuffle may depend on ALL the partitions prior
    // to the shuffle.
    // this causes a problem, because to recreate partitions past the shuffle
    // we would to rerun basically the entire job up to the shuffle.  Obviously,
    // Spark doesn't do this.  Instead, each shuffle writes output to disk
    // so that in the case of failure we can recompute based on the disk output
    // All of the disk output that happens with a shuffle is preserved
    // until the RDD is no longer used.

    // Can we write the shuffle output to RAM instead of disk
    // and preserve it for the entire lifetime of the RDD in memory? not sure

//    sc.parallelize(List("AK", "MS", "RI", "NY"))
//      .map(("region-TODO", _))
//      .filter({case (region,state) => region.equals("Northeast")})
    // we now have an RDD of states in the northeast, partitioned across cluster for processing

    //sort by line length
//    sc.textFile("somelines.txt")
//      .sortBy(_.length)
//      .collect()
//      .foreach(println)

    //We define operations to be on an RDD across a cluster, these operations
    // are broken up into tasks.
    // Sometimes these tasks rely on values in memory.
    // the *closure* of a task is all the variables and methods that
    // the executor (the thing that runs the task) needs to complete the task
    // Spark handles this for us and sends along the serialized closure with
    // the task.  This is good, but it can be a pitfall.  What we write as one
    // variable/value inside our driver will become multiple values in memory
    // distributed across the cluster alongside the tasks.

    // across the cluster.  Similar to counters in MapReduce.  We can define

    // it will work just fine

    // mostly matters if the value is large
