MapReduce Whitepaper:
- What does the Map part of MapReduce take in?  What does it output?
- What about the Reduce part of MapReduce?
- What is GFS?
- How many replications of data does GFS provide by default?  Block size?
  - HDFS, Hadoop Distributed FileSystem, is the same by default
- What is the optional Combiner step?
- Why is the Combiner step useful in the case of a wordcount?
- Is the Master fault tolerant?  Why or why not?
- Are the workers fault tolerant?  Why or why not?
- What happens to the output of completed Map tasks on failed worker nodes?
- What is Data Locality?  Why is it important?
- How does MapReduce increase processing speed when some machines in the cluster are running slowly but don't fail?
- What does a custom partitioning function change about how your MapReduce job runs?
- What is a hashcode?  How are hashcodes used in (default) partitions?
- What does it mean that side effects should be atomic and idempotent?
- What are Counters for?
- Where do Map tasks read from?  Write to?
- Where do Reduce tasks read from?  Write to?
- Which of the above I/O steps would you expect to take the longest?
