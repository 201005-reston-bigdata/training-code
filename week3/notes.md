### Week 3

Todos for this week / future:
- Hadoop and HDFS (and YARN, a bit), just basic MapReduce, no bells + whistles (Cloudera/HortonWorks)
    - After Hadoop became popular, we had the "Hadoop Explosion" where many many specific tools were created to use MapReduce in different contexts.
    - Cloudera Distribution Hadoop (CDH) provided a product that bundled these tools together alongside cluster management tools.
    - We aren't going to make use of most of these tools.
- Basic Unix-like OSs and commands on those
- Hive, part of the Hadoop explosion, SQL queries on Hadoop, still used all over the place.
- Spark + ...

Options for this week/future
- CDH quickstart VM, everything already set up, we don't need most of it, learn some cloudera manager
- Ubuntu (or similar) VM, we'd install Hadoop + more in Unix-like environment on our machine
- WSL2 another option
- Unix-like OS on AWS, install big data tools on Windows.

## Computers
So our computers have some computing resources: processors (CPU, cores + threads), memory (RAM + caches), long term storage (hard disk, SSD, HDD).  Procesors actually do operations, every single thing our computer does goes through the processor.  Kind of like the brain of the machine.  Memory (RAM) is short term memory, used to hold the values that go through the processor.  This includes holding our programs in memory, so the operations that go though the processor are stored here as well.  Storage is long term storage, it's the only part of the machine that remembers anything once the machine is turned off.  Files and folders go here, OS goes here.

## Virtual Machines (w/ VirtualBox)
A virtual machine is like your physical computer, but virtual.  It doesn't physically exist, it only virtually exists.  A physical computer somewhere needs to provide virtual resources to a virtual machine, which it can then use to run.  We call these two machines the *Host* and *Guest*.  There is some software called a *Hypervisor* that is responsible for creating and managing VMs.  VMs use their virtual resources the same way real machines use physical resources, for the most part VMs don't need to know that they're running on virtual resources.  We start up VMs from an *image* that contains the OS they are going to use and any files they should begin with.  We can create lightweight images that are mostly just an OS, or we can create heavy images that start the VM with many files/applications/etc on top of an OS.  

## AWS (Amazon Web Services) very basics
AWS provides computing resources to us in the cloud.  If we used AWS to explore Unix-like OSs, we'd have AWS spin up a server for us (called an EC2) and we'd connect to that server using ssh (Secure SHell).  We would then be able to interface with the Unix-like OS running on that server via the command line, ssh would pipe our commands from our local machine to Amazon's machine in a data center somewhere.  The potential benefit to us from this one is we're going to want to learn about Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) in the future.

## Unix and Unix-like OSs
Unix is an OS originally developed at Bell Labs in the 70s.  Unix became popular among hobbyists and academics.  Originally, Bell sold Unix in such a way that the peoiple who purchased Unix could modify its source code, expand its functionality, and share those changes with others.  Users in communities creates different versions of *distributions* of Unix, the one most notable to us today is BSD: Berkeley Software Distribution.  BSD is still around, still popular, and there's some BSD code in MacOS.

In the 80s, Bell attempts to sell Unix without granting these rights to modify, improve, and share its code.  This kills the market for Unix, with hobbyists and academics who use Unix keeping the older versions and working on those rather than getting new, closed Unix versions.  Another response to this move by Bell was the creation of the GNU project.  GNU is a cute acronym for GNU's Not Unix, the GNU project worked to recreate a Unix-like OS without using any actual Unix source code.

Development on GNU continues through the 80s, but GNU kernel development is not complete, Linus TOrvalds creates the Linux kernel which finishes out a complete OS GNU/Linux.  This is an OS with GNU project tools/files/programs and a Linux kernel.  From here, work is still happening on the Linux kernel, many Linux distributions are built, supported, forked, rebuilt, etc...

All of these OSs: Unix, BSD, and GNU/Linux are Unix-like, though only some of them contain actual Unix code.

## Open and closed source
Open source software is free (as in freedom) to be used for any purpose, users of the software can modify, redistribute, sell, etc.  Open Source software.  Notably, software that is Open source we sometimes have to pay for.  Free (libre, as in freedom) doesn't imply free (gratis, as in free beer), or vice versa.

There is some grey area, really what you can software for depends on its license.  Much closed source software out there offers the end user no freedom, just functionality.  A few licenses : 
- MIT license, classic open source, use this software for whatever you like.
- GPL (GNU's General Public License), this is a "copyleft" license that permits you to do anything with the software other than use it in closed source projects or sell it.

## Unix-like OS shell utilities

- ls : list files in the current directory
- cd .. : change directory to the parent directory
- cd dirname : change directory into a dirname
- two directories on your system are represented with symbols: ~ for your user's home directory and / for the root of the filesystem (the very top)
- pwd : print working directory, prints your current directory
- In Unix-like systems, each user's home directory is found in /home/username
- mkdir : makes a directory
- touch : makes a file (one of many ways)
- nano : command line text editor, easy and simple
- man <command> : shows you the manual for a given command
- command --help similar to man, print help output
- less filename : reads content of file, works well with large files
- cat filename : prints content of file to screen
- mv : moves a file from one location to another
  - refer to current directory with a .
  - also use mv to rename files
- cp : copy a file from one location to another
- rm : remove files.  Use the -r flag to remove directories recursively
- history : show history of commands
- clear : clear the screen
- ls -l : display contents of directory in long form, with more detail
  - In Unix-like operating systems, we can have *symbolic links* where one location in the filesystem links to another location. These are shown when we use ls -l.

All of the above commands, any any commands we run, are resolved by the shell the same way our 'java' command is resolved on Windows: the shell checks the PATH environment variables, searches directories on the PATH for the appropriate program, and runs that program.  Most/all of the command we listed above are programs found in /usr/bin (usr is Unix System Resources, bin is binaries)

Any time we're referring to a file or directory we can use its *absolute path* or its *relative path*.  An absolute path starts with / or ~ and specifies the exact location, regardless of where you are.  A relative path doesn't start with one of those, and it specifies where the file/dir is from your current location.

## Package managers

Every Linux distribution comes with a package manager that makes it easy to install, maintain, and keep applications up to date.  The one we have on Ubuntu is apt : Advanced Packaging Tool.  To make sure our installed applications are up to date, we can run:
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get upgrade
The sudo in each of those commands runs the command with elevated permissions.  Our default user has sudo permissions, which means they're allowed to use sudo (with a password) to run commands as the "super user" or "root", we use sudo when we're installing or removing applications and when we're modifying system files.

## Users, Groups, and permissions

In Unix-like OSs, we manage access that our users and applications have to files by specifying permissions based on users and groups and by placing users into the appropriate group(s).  We started off on WSL2 with a default user set up.  This user has to follow some permission rules when interacting with files/folders.  Each user is part of one or more group(s), and users in a group have additional permissions based on their membership.  For instance, my user "adam" is in the sudo group, which means I'm allowed to use sudo*.  Each user is at least in the group with their same name, i.e. adam is in group adam.

*sudoer permission is more granularly managed in a sudoers file (use visudo to access) that we probably won't need to touch.

Information about users and groups is found two files: /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  passwd contains user information, group contains group information.  We can also user commands like useradd and usermod to manipulate users and groups, instead of editing the files directly.

Each file has an associated user (owner) and an associated group.  Any files that the user "adam" creates will be default be associated with the user "adam" and the group "adam".  We are able to specify permissions on a file to be different based on owner/group/public.  For each of those categories, we specify whether read access, write access, and eXecute access are allowed.

We can modify the permissions on a file using the chmod command.  chmod takes 3 numbers to specify permissions for owner, group, public, along with the anme of the file/dir to modify.  Each number ranges from 0 to 7.  start at 0 for no permissions, add 4 if you want read permissions, add 2 if you want write permissions and add 1 if you want execute permissions.

Example: 777 is read+write+execute for all owner, group, and public.
Example: 755 is read+write+execute for owner, read+execute for group and public.

You can also see this as writing the number in binary, with each 1 providing a permission out of rwx and each 0 denying that permission.

Example: 777 is 111 111 111 which means full rwx rwx rwx for owner, group, public
Example: 755 is 111 101 101 which means rwx r-x r-x for owner, group, public
Example: 644 is 110 100 100 which means rw- r-- r--

## SSH : Secure SHell

SSH lets us make secure connections between machines over an insecure network.  To achieve this, we use keypairs with SSH.  We're going to need to run some related commands when setting up Hadoop, I just don't want us to be totally in the dark.  For now, a keypair lets two computers send traffic to each other that only they can read.
This works because each machine has both a public key that they share with the world, and a private key that they keep hidden.  Anyone can encrypt messages using a public key, only the holder of the private key will be able to decrypt them.
