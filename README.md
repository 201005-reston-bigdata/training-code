# training-code
contains demos and notes for reston big data batch

here is a change

basic git commands:
git clone - makes a local copy of a repo from github, only run once
git pull - retrieve changes from the remote repo to your local repo
git add . - step one in saving files to your local git repo
git commit -m "message!" - step two in saving files to your local git repo
git push - push saved changes from your local repository to github

FOR NOW, you'll just need git pull
FOR PJ0 we'll want to use all of the above
IN THE FUTURE we'll learn more!
